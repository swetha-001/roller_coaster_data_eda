# Roller Coaster Data EDA

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a roller coaster dataset. The goal was to understand the EDA process, explore patterns in the data, and practice data analysis techniques using Python libraries.

## Steps followed for Analysis :

### 1. Data Loading & Understanding

- Loaded dataset using Pandas

- Checked shape, info, and column types

- Previewed top and bottom rows

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing and duplicate values

- dropping irrelevant columns 

- Converted data types

- Renamed columns for clarity 

### 3. Univariate Analysis

- plotted distribution of coasters speed, height and year opened using bar chart, histogram

- Counted types and status of roller coasters

### 4. Bivariate Analysis

- Visualized Compared speed vs. height using scatter plot

- Analyzed trends over time using pairplot

- Visualized correlations using heatmaps

# Key Insights

- Many roller coasters were opened during the 1990s.

- Speed and height are positively correlated.

- Steel roller coasters are more common than wooden ones.

- Locations like Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Cedar Point and Six Flags Magic Mountain have the highest average speeds among roller coasters.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Pandas – data wrangling and manipulation

- Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

- Jupyter Notebook – interactive coding and analysis
